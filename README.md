# Data-Engineering-project
The startup Sparkify wants to examine the information they've been gathering on songs and user behavior on their brand-new music streaming service. The analytics team is very curious to know which music users are listening to. They now lack a simple means to query their data, which is stored in directories containing JSON logs on user activity on the app and JSON information on the songs in their app.  A Spark ETL Pipeline was developed, which reads the data kept in S3 and enables Sparkify to interpret and analyze their data in a distributed manner.
